# You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that 
# the two endp lineoints of the ith are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together 
# with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the 
# maximum amount of water a container can store. Notice that you may not slant the container.
# Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49
